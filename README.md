# Express_Deployed_Weather_Fetch_Web_APP

### The Express Deployed Weather Fetch Web APP utilizes the data of [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as raw material. It first presents a web page where users could input the latitude and longitude of a location, and then the realtime weather condition in the moment as well as that in the next 7 days will be loaded.

## SKILLS:
#### It covers the knowledge of **_HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,  Js, backend Node.js and  Express**

## HOW DOES IT WORK:
#### The project is run on local server and deployed by Node.js.  The repo contains the backend file: app. js which I run through by nodemon (a package installed through npm: node package manager) to simplify the node.js restart procedures in terminal.
